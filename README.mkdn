Android Open Kang Project
=========================





Getting Started
---------------

Please see the [Android source page](http://source.android.com/source/index.html) for building instructions.

To initialize your local repository using my trees, use the following command:

    repo init -u https://github.com/AOKP/platform_manifest.git -b ics

Then to sync up:

    repo sync



Building
--------

After the sync is finished, please read the [instructions from the Android site](http://s.android.com/source/building.html) on how to build.

Once you've read that, you can build with

    mka

This will compile everything and use the correct "-j#" flag.

You can also build a flashable zip with

    mka otapackage
    
    
Special Thanks

Huge shout out to [@peteralfonzo](http://twitter.com/peteralfonso) for his wonderfully clean vendor tree to use as a base. This makes this infinitely more oragnized and easier to work with. Thank him!
